rho

\description{
Calculates the change in rate between the first half and the
second half of the phylogeny. Rho = (r2 - r1) / (r1 + r2), where r reflects
the rate in either the first or second half. The rate within a half is given
by (log(n2) - log(n1) / t, where n2 is the number of lineages at the end of
the half, and n1 the number of lineages at the start of the half. Rho varies
between -1 and 1, with a 0 indicating a constant rate across the phylogeny,
a rho < 0 indicating a slow down and a rho > 0 indicating a speed up of
speciation. In contrast to the gamma statistic, Pigot's rho is not sensitive
to tree size.
