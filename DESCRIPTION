Description: Collection of phylogenetic tree statistics,
             collected throughout the literature. All functions have been
             written to maximize computation speed. 
             The package includes umbrella functions to calculate all
             statistics, all balance statistics, or all branching time related
             statistics. Furthermore, the treestats package supports summary
             statistic calculations on Ltables, provides speed-improved coding
             of branching times, Ltable conversion and includes algorithms to
             create intermediately balanced trees.
